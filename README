bcov produces coverage information without recompiling a program
by instrumenting it with breakpoints. Effectively it debugs the
program automatically, removing each breakpoint after it has been
hit. Currently only the main binary itself is instrumented.

Usage: bcov binary [argument(s)]

Executes the binary with the given arguments and stores the
coverage summary in .bcovdump. The result file is more or less
human readable (and easily machine readable), a nicer presentation
can be generated with bcov-report:

Usage: bcov-report [dumpfile] [output directory]

Converts the coverage dump into an lcov-style html report. If
not output directory is given bcov-report uses a temporary directory
and tries to open the result in the standard browser.
